#### Create weather forecast

Using weather data from [KMA](http://www.weather.go.kr/weather/forecast/mid-term_01.jsp), write a code to produce weather outlook/statement that looks like the section, "Detailed Forecast" in [NWS](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=32.8769&lon=-117.2365#.W6xEdC-B1-U).

+ Pick a region you want to make forecast.
+ In addition to max/min temperature, please add a statement that compares it with the climatological values.
+ Try to create your own class to do this job.
+ Turn in the python file or jupyter notebook file by next Thursday.
