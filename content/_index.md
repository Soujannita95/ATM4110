# Programming in Meteorology

**This webpage is designed to serve the students enrolled for ATM4110, Programming in Meteorology.**

This course will provide the programming foundation to perform the analysis and diagnostics of the big dataset in the atmospheric sciences.
Upon the completion of this course, the students will be capable of analyzing the atmospheric data and extracting meaningful information from it.

#### Objective of this course
+ **Introduce the programming environment for meteorology**
+ **Handle the atmospheric data using programming language such as python**
+ **Learn temporal/spatial/spectral analysis skills**
+ **Solve problems using acquired skills in programming and produce meaningful results**

#### A few examples that you can do after this course
+ Draw figures using atmospheric data on the map (*[source](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs)*):

If you have an issue with Python, you may find [this online material](http://files.swaroopch.com/python/byte_of_python.pdf) be helpful.

#### The repository for the Jupyter Notebook files.
I will upload the Jupyter Notebook files at [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/hajsong/libraries/atm4110)
