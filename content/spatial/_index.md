### Optimal interpolation

In the class, we ran the code that optimally interpolate the pseudo observations onto the regularly gridded space.
The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](/ATM4110/images/mercator_temperature.mat).

And the jupyter notebook for this exercise is [here.](/ATM4110/images/optimal_interpolation.ipynb)

### Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs)
As an exercise, we will compute the EOFs of the Pacific SST following the code by John Wilkin (Rutgers Univ.).

The dataset can be downloaded from [this link](/ATM4110/images/cac.mat) and [this link](/ATM4110/images/soi.mat).

And the python code for this exercise is [here.](/ATM4110/images/eofs_exercise.py)
