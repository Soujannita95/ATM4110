{{% panel %}}The material here is based on the Chapter 3-5 in "A Hands-On Introduction to Using Python in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences" by Johnny Wei-Bing Lin.{{% /panel %}}


Python, like any other programming language, has variables and all the standard
control structures. We will go though Pythonâ€™s basic data and
control structures that support procedural programming.
Then we will explore how to use arrays, followed by file input and output.

*A few list of changes in Python 3.x that differs from Python 2.x*

+ The ```print``` function syntax now looks like any other function, e.g., ```print("Hello")```.
+ The division operator uses floating point division, even when both the numerator and denominator are integers.
+ Using ```raise``` to raise an exception has a new syntax.
+ Dictionary methods ```keys``` and ```values``` no longer return lists. Neither does range. To make lists out of the return values, use the ```list``` function.
+ Dictionaries no longer have the ```has_key``` method. Test instead for ```key``` in ```dict``` (where ```key``` is the key of interest and ```dict``` is your dictionary object). Note that if a value in your dictionary is the same as ```key```, the membership testing will not return ```True```.
+ Relative imports (i.e., importing a module in the current directory) require the use of . in front of the module name.
+ The version of NumPy generally installed with Python 3.x has a function ```ndim``` that gives the number of dimensions of an array, rather than ```rank```.
