The Jupyter Notebook supports over 40 different programming languages, and Python is just one of them.
That means that once you know how to use the Jupyter Notebook, you can use it for other languages.

The Jupyter Notebook is making one of the most significant advances in the scientific computing.
Here is what [*Nature* says about the Jupyter Notebook in 2014](https://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261)

Here are a few examples of IPython Notebooks for science:

+ [LIGO Gravitational Wave Data](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html)
+ [Satellite Imagery Analysis](http://unidata.github.io/python-gallery/examples/Satellite_Example.html)
+ [12 Steps to Navier-Stokes](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython)
+ [Computer Vision](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/Labeled%2520Faces%2520in%2520the%2520Wild%2520recognition.ipynb)
