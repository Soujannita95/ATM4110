To get the most out of Linux, you should become proficient in using the shell. It might initially be more difficult than icons and menus, but once you're used to it, the shell is quite easy to use and very powerful.

#### How to run a shell

If you have Linux, running a shell is just opening *Terminal* or something similar to it. However, if you are running Windows (I think this is the most case), then you can experience Linux with the third-party program like [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net).

This program offers a shell environment and (I think) you can do most of the common tasks of Linux with it.

Please get this (free) and set up in your computer.

#### Quick start

Once you install MobaXterm, go to "Session" and select "Shell". 
This will open the terminal in bash shell environment.  
You can check your shell environment by typing the follow command.
```
$ echo $SHELL
```
This will give you ```/bin/bash.exe```.
