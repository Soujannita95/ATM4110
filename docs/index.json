	"content": " To get the most out of Linux, you should become proficient in using the shell. It might initially be more difficult than icons and menus, but once you\u0026rsquo;re used to it, the shell is quite easy to use and very powerful.\nHow to run a shell If you have Linux, running a shell is just opening Terminal or something similar to it. However, if you are running Windows (I think this is the most case), then you can experience Linux with the third-party program like MobaXterm.\nThis program offers a shell environment and (I think) you can do most of the common tasks of Linux with it.\nPlease get this (free) and set up in your computer.\nQuick start Once you install MobaXterm, go to \u0026ldquo;Session\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Shell\u0026rdquo;. This will open the terminal in bash shell environment.\nYou can check your shell environment by typing the follow command.\n$ echo $SHELL  This will give you /bin/bash.exe.\nTo finish a shell You can come out of the shell by exit.\n$ exit  "

	"content": " Filesystem structure Every Linux file is contained in a collection called a directory. Directories are like folders on Windows and Mac systems. Directories form a hierarchy, or tree: one directory may contain other directories, called subdirectories, which may themselves contain other files and subdirectories, and so on, into infinity. The topmost directory is called the root directory and is denoted by a slash (/).\nPath We refer to files and directories using a \u0026ldquo;names and slashes\u0026rdquo; syntax called a path. To find out the current path, try\n$ pwd  and you will get your current location in the filesystem.\nThere are two types of path. The first one is an absolute path. The absolute path starts from the root directory and has all the names of directories in the upper level. The second type is a relative path. The relative path does not start with the root directory or contain all the names of directories in the upper levels.\ncd [directory] To move your location in the shell environment, you can use the cd command:\n$ cd /one/two/three  This command line moves you from your working directory (or current location) to /one/two/three. This example uses the absolute path to go to the new working directory. From here, you can use the relative path to go to /one/two with the following command:\n$ cd ..  In the shell environment, \u0026quot;..\u0026quot; means the upper level. (\u0026quot;.\u0026quot; means the current level.) You can use \u0026quot;..\u0026quot; as many times as you want. For example, if you want to move to /one from /one/two/three, you can type:\n$ cd ../..  Please note that you can achieve the same result with the absolute path:\n$ cd /one  Each user has own home directories where users\u0026rsquo; personal files are often found. In general, the path of the home directory starts with /home. To find out the absolute path for your home directory, try:\n$ echo $HOME  Linux offers a command that brings you to your home directory from anywhere. All you can do is just type cd with no arguments. It also provides a simple way to write the absolute path of your home directory with a special character, ~. Check this out.\n$ echo ~  You will get the same result as above. This special character can be quite handy. Suppose you want to move to Documents/Public in your home directory from /one/two/three. Then you can just type:\n$ cd ~/Documents/Public  If another username follows ~, the shell expands this string to be the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory:\n$ cd ~smith $ pwd /home/smith  mkdir [options] directory mkdir creates one or more directories:\n$ mkdir dirname  rm -r dirname will delete the directory called dirname.

	"content": " Unix/Linux? Most computing/programming in both atmospheric and oceanic sciences happens on Unix/Linux operating system, instead of Windows. What are the advantages of using Unix/Linux? I do not have the exact answer for why, but there must be a reason for people preferring typing and executing programs instead of clicking on windows (although Linux also provides graphical user interfaces).\nThe computing/programming in the atmospheric sciences means you create/read/process/write atmospheric data. All these jobs involve the design of the workflow from you, and it is important to be powerful, efficient and flexible in doing those. Unix is particularly suited to working in such an environment and has many powerful (and flexible) commands that can help you.\nAlso, according to Biocomputing Bootcamp, \u0026ldquo;The real strength of learning Unix is that most of these commands can be combined in an almost unlimited fashion. So if you can learn just five Unix commands, you will be able to do a lot more than just five things. Our objective here is to learn a subset of Unix and to become a productive Unix user without knowing or using every program and feature.\u0026rdquo;\nI refered to Linux, pocket guide by Daniel J. Barrett in introducing Linux system.\nHistory (and family) of Unix A varied operating systems, including macOS, have branched out from Unix. Simplified history of Unix-like operating systems (Wikipedia).\nLinux is one of the operating system that stems from UNIX and naturally shares similar architecture and concepts. It is an open-source software!\nPrograming on Linux \u0026ldquo;A common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at scripting, text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support shell scripts, awk, sed and make. Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, regular expressions are supported in programs like grep and locate, the traditional Unix MTA Sendmail contains its own Turing complete scripting system, and the advanced text editor GNU Emacs is built around a general purpose Lisp interpreter.\u0026rdquo; (From Wikipedia)\nFour major parts in Linux The kernel The low-level operation system, handling files, disks, networking and other necessities we take for granted.\nSupplied program Thousands of programs for file manipulation, text editing, mathematics, typesetting, audio, video, computer programming, website creation, encryption\u0026hellip; you name it.\nThe shell A user interface for typing commands, executing them, and displaying results. There are various shells in existence: the Bourne shell, Korn shell, C shell, and others. We will focus on bash, the Bourne Shell, which is often the default for user accounts. However, all these shells have similar basic functions.\nX A graphical system that provides windows, menus, icons, mouse support, and other familiar GUI elements. More complex graphical environments are built on X; the most popular are KDE and GNOME.\n"

	"content": " Once we arrive the working directory, the next thing we want to do might be manipulating files: copying, renaming, deleting and so forth. This page introduces a few things that can be useful in handling files in a Linux system.\nIf you need a short guide for the command, try with --help option. The content on this page mostly comes from Linux pocket guide by Daniel J. Barrett.\n ls [options] [files] The ls command lists attributes of files and directories. You can list files in the current directory:\n$ ls  in a given directories:\n$ ls dir1 dir2 dir3  or individually:\n$ ls file1 file2 file3  The most important options are -a and -l. By default, ls hides files whose names begin with a dot. The option -a displays all files including those starting with .(dot). The -l option produces a long listing, for example:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 3376 Sep 3 08:18 _index.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 1340 Sep 3 12:53 configuration.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 3301 Sep 3 13:05 fileoperation.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 2707 Sep 3 12:52 filesystem.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 1066 Sep 3 11:23 shell.md  that includes, from left to right: the file\u0026rsquo;s permissions, owner, group, size, last modification date and name. When using the -l option, the list is created in the alphabetical order of the file names. It is sometimes useful to find out the most recently modified file. In this case, you can change the order according to the modification times.\n$ ls -ltr  The result looks like:\n-rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 3376 Sep 3 08:18 _index.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 1066 Sep 3 11:23 shell.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 2707 Sep 3 12:52 filesystem.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 1340 Sep 3 12:53 configuration.md -rw-r--r-- 1 hajsong staff 3787 Sep 3 13:08 fileoperation.md  Here, -t makes the order according to the modification time, and -r reverses the order so that the latest comes to the bottom of the list. You may already notice that you can combine options by just line them up.\ncp [options] [files] (file/dir) The cp command copies a file:\n$ cp file file2  Using the -R option, you can also recursively copy directories.\n$ cp -R dir1 dir2  will create dir2 which is the same as dir1.\nUseful options\n -f: Force the copy. If a destination file exists, overwrite it unconditionally. -i: Interactive mode. Ask before overwriting destination files.  ln [options] source target A link is a reference to another file, created by the ln command. There are two kinds of links. A symbolic link refers to another file by its path, much like a Windows \u0026ldquo;shortcut\u0026rdquo; or a Mac \u0026ldquo;alias\u0026rdquo;.\n$ ln -s myfile softlink  If you delete the original file, the now-dangling link will be invalid, pointing to a nonexistent file path. A hard link, on the other hand, is simply a second name for a physical file on disk. Deleting the original file does not invalidate the link.\nIf you leave the softlink blank, then you get the link with the same name.\n$ ln myfile hardlink  Symbolic link can cross disk partitions, since they are just references to file paths. Hard links cannot. Symbolic links can also point to directories, whereas hard links cannot.\nIt is easy to find out where a symbolic link points with either of these command.\n$ readlink softlink  or\n$ ls -l softlink  useful options\n -s: Make a symbolic link. The default is a hard link. -i: Interactive mode. Ask before overwriting destination files. -f: Force the link. If a destination file exists, overwrite it unconditionally.  mv [options] source target The mv command can rename a file:\n$ mv file1 file2  or move files and directories into a destination directory.\n$ mv file1 destination_directory  useful options\n -i: Interactive mode. Ask before overwriting destination files. -f: Force the move. If a destination file exists, overwrite it unconditionally.  rm [options] files/directories The rm command can delete files:\n$ rm file1 file2 file3  or recursively delete directories:\nrm -r dir1 dir2  useful options\n -i: Interactive mode. Ask before deleting each file. -f: Force the deletion, ignoring any errors or warnings. -r: recursively remove a directory and its contents. USE WITH CAUTION, especially if combined with the -f option.  Beware! Once you delete the files or directories with rm, it is impossible or very difficult to recover them. "

	"content": " 1. File viewing In Linux, you are going to handle files with lots of different types, and want to see what\u0026rsquo;s in there. On this page, we will explore how to view the file contents if they are in text in the Linux system.\ncat [options] [files] The simplest viewer is cat, which just copies its files to standard output, concatenating them.\n$ cat filename  This command dump all the contents on the screen, so large files will likely scroll off screen. If this is the case, you may consider using less command.\nuseful options\n -n: Prepend line numbers to every line  less [options] [files] Use less to view text one page at a time (or one window or screenful at a time). It\u0026rsquo;s great for text files.\nWhile running less, type h for a help message, but here are a few keystroke being used often.\n   Keystroke Meaning     h, H View a help page.   spacebar, f Move forward one screenful.   Enter Move forward one line.   b Move backward one screenful   / Enter search model. n goes to the next match, while N goes to the previous match.   q quite less.    useful options\n N: Prepend line numbers to the output.  Other useful commands head and tail are also useful in viewing files. To find out how to use them, you can refer to the manual after calling it.\n$ man head or $ man tail  The manual of these command will be printed on the screen using less command. That means that you can move around between pages using the keystrokes in the table above.\n2. File Creation and Editing Creating files is easy and can be done in many different ways in Linux. Instead of printing out the output on the screen, you can create a file containing the output by redirecting it.\n$ echo save text in the file \u0026gt; output $ ls -l \u0026gt; listdir  You can also quickly create an empty file using touch command,\n$ touch newfile  If you want to create and edit a file, you can try text editors. Two major text editors are emacs and vim in Linux, and new files can be created with the following commands.\n$ emacs newfile or $ vim newfile  There is a steep learning curve for these editors, but once you get familiar with them, you can do so many things very efficiently. Throughout the course, you need to create many text files to analyze the atmospheric data, and these text editors may boost your productivity.\nI use vim daily basis. So, I will introduce it briefly here with a few examples (There are tons of material about these text editors online. Of course, you do not have to use them.)\nvim [options] [files] You can open up the tutorial of vim withe command below.\n$ vimtutor  To exit from vimtutor, do :q.\n vim operates in two modes, insert and normal. Insert mode is for entering text in the usual manner, while normal mode is for running commands like \u0026ldquo;delete a line\u0026rdquo; or copy/paste.\nHere are basic keystrokes in normal mode.\n   Keystroke Meaning     $ vim run editor in current terminal.   i enter insert mode.   esc exit insert mode back to normal mode   :q quit vim when there is no modification   :q! quit vim without saving modification   :wq quit vim by overwriting the file with modification   :w save modification (overwrite)   :w filename save as filename   u undo   ^R redo   l or right arrow move forward   h or left arrow move backward   k or up arrow move up   j or down arrow move down   w move to next word   b move to previous word   e move to the end of the current word   0 move to beginning of line   $ move to end of line   ^f move down 1 screen   ^b move up 1 screen   gg move to beginning of buffer   G move to end of buffer i   x delete next character   X delete previous character   dd delete current line   de delete all characters to the end of the current word   dw delete all characters before the beginning of the next word   de delete all characters from the beginning of the current word   d0 delete all characters from the beginning of the current line   d$ delete all characters to the end of the current line   yy copy current line   ye copy all characters to the end of the current word   yw copy all characters before the beginning of the next word   ye copy all characters from the beginning of the current word   y0 copy all characters from the beginning of the current line   y$ copy all characters to the end of the current line   p paste   r and character replace with the character   R replace mode   o enter insert mode at the one line below   O enter insert mode at the one line up   . repeat the previous action   : switch to command mode    If you are in the intert mode, editing the text is quite similar to other programs like MS words.\n "

The division operator uses floating point division, even when both the numerator and denominator are integers. Using raise to raise an exception has a new syntax. Dictionary methods keys and values no longer return lists. Neither does range. To make lists out of the return values, use the list function. Dictionaries no longer have the has_key method. Test instead for key in dict (where key is the key of interest and dict is your dictionary object). Note that if a value in your dictionary is the same as key, the membership testing will not return True. Relative imports (i.e., importing a module in the current directory) require the use of . in front of the module name.

	"description": "",
	"content": " 1. Overview of basic variables and operators Unlike languages like Fortran, Python is dynamically typed, variables take on the type of whatever they are set to when they are assigned. Thus, a=5 makes the variable a an integer, but a=5.0 makes the variable a floating point number. Additionally, because assignment can happen anytime during the program, this means you can change the type of the variable without changing the variable name.\nThe built-in variable types include:\n integer and floating point strings booleans : True and False nonetype : None lists and tuples : variable v.s. fixed dictionaries : consists of keys and values  Python is case-sensitive, so \u0026ldquo;N\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;n\u0026rdquo; are different. 2. Integer and Float The easiest way to get the idea of integer and float is probably with an example. If we define variables as the following:\na = 3.5 b = -2.1 c = 3 d = 4  Then arithmetic operations below\na*b b+c a/c c/d  give us\n# a*b -7.3500000000000005 # b+c 0.8999999999999999 # a/c 1.1666666666666667 # c/d (in Python2) 0 # c/d (in Python3) 0.75  We did not specify the data type, but Python automatically decides what type a variable based on the value/operation. For example, c/d returns integer because c and d are integers. Python will generally make the output type the type that retains the most information, so a/c returns float.\nHere’s a question: Why is the answer to a*b not exactly -7.35? Remember that floating point numbers on any binary computer are, in general, not represented exactly. The default formatting setting for the print command, will sometimes print out enough of the portion after the decimal point to show that.\n3. Strings String variables are created by setting text in either paired single or double quotes. For example,\na = 'hello' b = \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot;  both work as long as they are consistently paired.\nSome \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; strings include:\n \\n: newline character \\t: tab character \\\\: backslash  \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=\u0026quot;Hello \\nHello\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) Hello Hello \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=\u0026quot;Hello \\tHello\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) Hello Hello \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=\u0026quot;Hello \\\\Hello\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) Hello \\Hello  Python uses the addition operator to join strings together.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=\u0026quot;Hello\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b=\u0026quot; world\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a+b+'!') Hello world! \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a+b 'Hello world'  4. Booleans Boolean variables are variables that can have only one of two values: True and False. In some languages, the integer value zero is considered false and the integer value one is considered true, which was the case in older versions of Python. Although this still seems to work in recent versions of Python, using True and False reduces ambiguity.\nNote the capitalization matters. \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=true Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; NameError: name 'true' is not defined \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=True  Try this in a Python interpreter:\na = True b = False print(a and b) print(a or b) print(4 \u0026gt; 5)  What did you get?\n5. NoneType A variable of NoneType can have only a single value, the value None (N has to be capitalized). Try this in a Python interpreter:\na = None print(a is None) print(a == 4)  The first print statement will return True, while the second print statement will return False. The is operator compares \u0026ldquo;equality\u0026rdquo; not in the sense of value but in the sense of memory location. Although \u0026ldquo;a == None\u0026rdquo; also works, the better syntax for comparing to None is \u0026ldquo;a is None\u0026rdquo;.\nThis NoneType variables can be useful to safely initialize a parameter. After initialize a parameter with None, you need to assign a value before doing an operation. Otherwise, Python will give an error. This is a simple way to make sure that the variable is set to a real value.\n6. Lists and tuples Lists are ordered sequences. The items in the list do not have to be of the same type. You can define a list with both numbers and strings, and even another list.\nTo define a list, you use square brackets and commas.\na = [2, 3.2, 'hello', [-1.2, 'there', 5.5]]  To access elements, you use addresses that starts with zero. For example, the first element of a is a[0], the second is a[1]. If the element of the list is also a list, you can access the element with, for example, a[3][1]. In Python, list elements can also be addressed starting from the end; thus, a[-1] is the last element in list a, a[-2] is the next to last element, etc.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[3][1] 'there' \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[-1] [-1.2, 'there', 5.5] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[-2] 'hello'  You can create new lists by slicing an existing list.\nThe lower limit of the range is inclusive, and the upper limit of the range is exclusive.\n \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[0:3] [2, 3.2, 'hello'] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[1:3] [3.2, 'hello'] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[2:3] ['hello'] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[3:3] []  The length of a list can be obtained using the len function.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; len(a) 4 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; len(a[0]) Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len() \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; len(a[3]) 3  The element can be replaced with other types of item without any issues.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[2] = 0.0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a [2, 3.2, 0.0, [-1.2, 'there', 5.5]]  Python allows you to modify the list by providing build-in functions. When a = [2, 3.2, 'hello', [-1.2, 'there', 5.5]],\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.insert(2,'everyone') \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) [2, 3.2, 'everyone', 'hello', [-1.2, 'there', 5.5]] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.remove(2) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) [3.2, 'everyone', 'hello', [-1.2, 'there', 5.5]] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) [3.2, 'everyone', 'hello', [-1.2, 'there', 5.5], 4.5]  Tuples are nearly identical to lists with the exception that tuples cannot be changed! To define tuples, you use parenthesis instead of square brackets.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b = (3.2, 'hello') \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b[0] 3.2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b[0]=1 Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment  You can, to an extent, treat strings as lists. Thus, if a = \u0026ldquo;hello\u0026rdquo;, then a[1:3] will return the substring \u0026ldquo;el\u0026rdquo;.  If the list contains lots of elements, you can break the list after the completion of an element and continue the list on the next line. Or you can put a backslash (\u0026rdquo;\\\u0026ldquo;) at the end of a line  7. Dictionaries Dictionaries are unordered lists whose elements are referenced by keys, not by position. Keys refer to Values that can be anything.\nWhen defining a dictionary, you use curly braces (\u0026ldquo;{}\u0026rdquo;). The elements of a dictionary are \u0026ldquo;Key:Value\u0026rdquo; pairs, separated by a colon. For example,\na = {'a':2, 'b':3.2, 'c':[-1.2, 'there', 5.5]}  It is similar to lists to access the elements, except you use the keys.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a['a'] 2 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a['c'] [-1.2, 'there', 5.5]  There are a few built-in functions for dictionaries.\n a.keys() : show all the keys a.values() : show all the values  "

	"content": " I refer to Unidata online python training page for this page.  I recommend you to visit Unidata Online Python Training page. The main program language we will use in this course to handle atmospheric data is python. Before getting into \u0026ldquo;What is Python?\u0026rdquo;, here is one of the statements that shows why we want to learn it\n  I have used a combination of Perl, Fortran, NCL, Matlab, R and others for routine research, but found out this general- purpose language, Python, can handle almost all in an efficient way from requesting data from remote online sites to statistics, and graphics.  What Is Python?  ## What is Python? --- #### Python is a “batteries included” computer programming language. More concretely, Python is a programming language that, in contrast to other programming languages such as C, Fortran, or Java, allows users to more readily focus and solve domain problems instead of dealing with the complexity of how a computer operates. Python achieves this goal by having the following attributes: --- #### Python is a **high-level** language. It abstracts underlying computer-related technical details. For example, Python does not make its users think too much about computer memory management or proper declaration of variables and uses safe assumptions about what the programmer is trying to convey. In addition, a high-level language can be expressed in a manner closer to English prose or mathematical equations. --- #### Python is a **general-purpose** language. It can be used for all problems that a computer is capable of rather than specializing in a specific area such as statistical analysis. For example, Python can be used for both artificial intelligence and statistical analysis. Python can be used for a variety of heterogeneous tasks within a given work-flow. --- #### Python is an **interpreted** language. Evaluation of code to obtain results can happen immediately rather than having to go through a time-consuming, compile and run cycle, which thereby speeds up the thinking and experimentation processes. IPython is an interactive form of the Python language also invented by Fernando Pérez. These environments excel for rapid-prototype of code or quick and simple experimentation with new ideas. --- #### Python has a strong tools for solving problems. A standard library and numerous third-party libraries (e.g. numpy, matplotlib,...) yield a vast array of existing codebases and examples for solving problems. --- #### Python has many, many users It allows users to quickly find solutions and example code to problems with the help of Google and Stackoverflow.       function initSlides() { Reveal.initialize({ embedded : true, controls : false, center: true ,\thistory: false , progress: false , transition: \"fade\", dependencies: [ { src: '\\/ATM4110\\/revealjs\\/lib\\/js\\/classList.js\"', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, { src: '\\/ATM4110\\/revealjs\\/plugin\\/markdown\\/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '\\/ATM4110\\/revealjs\\/plugin\\/markdown\\/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: '\\/ATM4110\\/revealjs\\/plugin\\/highlight\\/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, { src: '\\/ATM4110\\/revealjs\\/plugin\\/zoom-js\\/zoom.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } }, { src: '\\/ATM4110\\/revealjs\\/plugin\\/notes\\/notes.js', async: true, condition: function() { return !!document.body.classList; } } ] }); }   See it fullscreen var toto = document.getElementById('slideContent').innerHTML document.getElementById('slideFrame').contentWindow.document.write(document.getElementById('slideContent').innerHTML); document.getElementById('slideContent').remove(); document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\",function(){ setTimeout(function () { document.getElementById('slideFrame').contentWindow.initSlides() ; }, 2000); }); function slideFullScreen() { document.open(); document.write(toto); document.close(); initSlides() }  These features, perhaps, come with a minor cost of reduced language performance, but this is a trade-off the vast majority of users are willing to make in order to gain all the advantages Python has to offer.\nwhat you can do with Python? Python is not just for atmospheric sciences. It has a wide area of application, and earth science is one of them. Largely, you may categorize applications into:\n Web development Data science  1. Web development Python can be used to create the webpage. We all know that webpage is basically html files (not Python). Although you can edit html files for the webpage, you can also use python to create html files for you. This is what I did to create the ATM2106 class webpage.\nSome sites wait for the input from the users and process the job before delivering the results back to users (Like Amazon). Python can play an important role in these dynamic websites. For example, one of my friends build the website called Trevii which helps you organize the trip after gathering informations online. The backbone of this website is also python!\n2. Data science In some sense, the purpose of using Python in this course is to do data science. Python is efficient when handling a large dataset. It does not necessarily faster than other programming languages like Fortran or C, as mentioned above. This is because Python has to figure out the data type while users specify it for Fortran or C. If you tell Python the data type, then it can process the data with much higher speed (approaching the speed of Fortran or C).\nHere, Data science includes machine learning! Here is an example from Towards Data Science.\nThe goal of this machine learning is to find out how to combine three numbers we provide. The first task is to generate training set.\nfrom random import randint TRAIN_SET_LIMIT = 1000 TRAIN_SET_COUNT = 100 TRAIN_INPUT = list() TRAIN_OUTPUT = list() for i in range(TRAIN_SET_COUNT): a = randint(0, TRAIN_SET_LIMIT) b = randint(0, TRAIN_SET_LIMIT) c = randint(0, TRAIN_SET_LIMIT) op = a + (2*b) + (3*c) TRAIN_INPUT.append([a, b, c]) TRAIN_OUTPUT.append(op)  The training set consists of 100 sets of three numbers, a, b, and c, and op = a + 2*b + 3*c. You can adjust the size of the training set by modifying TRAIN_SET_COUNT.\nNow, we will train the machine with this dataset. The package scikit-learn allows us to do machine learning easily.\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression predictor = LinearRegression() predictor.fit(X=TRAIN_INPUT, y=TRAIN_OUTPUT)  The machine learning is done, and predictor will compute op with three inputs.\nX_TEST = [[10, 20, 30]] outcome = predictor.predict(X=X_TEST) coefficients = predictor.coef_ print('Outcome : {}\\nCoefficients : {}'.format(outcome, coefficients))  We see that the coefficients from machine learning are exactly same as the one used in the training set. There are online courses from Stanford and Caltech if you are interested in learning it more.\n"

	"content": " 1. Functions Functions in Python, in theory, work both like functions and subroutines in Fortran, in that (1) input comes via arguments and (2) output occurs through: a return variable (like Fortran functions) and/or arguments (like Fortran subroutines). In practice, functions in Python are written to act like Fortran functions, with a single output returned. (The return value is specified by the return statement.) If you want multiple returns, it’s easier to put them into a list or use objects.\nFunction definitions begin with a def statement, followed by the name of the function and the argument list in parenthesis. At the end of this line comes colon. The contents of the function are written with indents (usually 4 spaces). When there is no indentation, Python assumes that the definition of the function is finished.\nFor example, the function to compute the area of the circle can be written as\ndef area(radius): area = 3.14 * (radius**2) return area  If you define this function without indentation, Python gives you an error as this.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; def area(radius): ... area = 3.14 * (radius**2) File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 2 area = 3.14*(radius**2) ^ IndentationError: expected an indented block  Once you define the function, you can use it with the syntax in the definition.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = area(3) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) 28.26  Python accepts both positional and keyword arguments in the argument list of a function. Positional arguments are usually for required input while keyword arguments are usually for optional input. Typically, keyword arguments are set to some default value. If you do not want to have a default value set for the keyword, a safe practice is to just set the keyword to None.\nWe may tweak the previous area function by placing a keyword argument.\ndef area(radius, pi=None): area = pi * (radius**2) return area  What would you expect to see with a = area(3)? How about a = area(3, pi=3.14)?\nA list and dictionary variable can be useful when passing positional and keyword arguments.\nargs = [3,] kwds = {'pi':3.14} a = area(*args, **kwds)  As you can see above, a list args and kwds can be passed to the function area. This is particularly useful when the function needs many positional and keyword arguments.\nThere are some rules for passing in function arguments by lists and dictionaries:\n In the function call, put an asterisk (*) before the list that contains the positional arguments and put two asterisks (**) before the dictionary that contains the keyword arguments. The list of positional arguments is a list where each element in the list is a positional argument to be passed in, and the list is ordered in the same order as the positional arguments. The dictionary of keyword arguments uses string keys corresponding to the name of the keyword and the value of the key:value pairs as the value set to the keyword parameter.  2. Logical constructs You may be already familiar with logical constructs. In Python, the syntax for if-statements is\nif \u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;:  followed by the block of code to execute if  is true. There is no need for an \u0026ldquo;endif\u0026rdquo; line because indentation defines the contents of the if block. a = 3 if a == 3: print('I am a ', a) elif a == 2: print('I am a 2') else: print('I am not a 3 or 2')  Don’t forget the colon at the end of if, elif, and else statements 3. Looping The loop is also popular part of the programming. In Python, the loop begins with for.\nfor \u0026lt;index\u0026gt; in \u0026lt;list\u0026gt;:  Do not forget the colon at the end of the syntax.\nAs the if statement, the contents of the loop is defined with indentation. That means that the loop does not require the line with enddo or something like that.\nThe for loop is little different compared to the Fortran do loops. In Fortran, you specify a beginning value and an ending value (often 1 and an integer n) for an index, and the loop runs through all integers from that beginning value to that ending value, setting the index to that value. In Python, the loop index runs through a list of items, and the index is assigned to each item in that list, one after the other, until the list of items is exhausted. For example,\nfor i in [2, -3.3, 'hello', 1, -12]: print(i)  prints out\n2 -3.3 hello 1 -12  As mentioned in the previous page, list variables can have any variable types as elements.\nIf the iteration through numbers is desirable like Fortran, you can use a function range.\nfor i in range(5): print(i)  In Python2, range creates a list. But in Python3, it creates a range type variable.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = range(3) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a range(0, 3) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; list(a) [0, 1, 2]  The advantage of the range type in Python3 over the list type in Python2 is the reduced usage of the memory. In Python3, you do not need to secure memories for, for example, range(100000000).\nThe range function takes the form of range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]).  Another useful function is enumerate. Here is an example.\na = [2, -3.3, 'hello', 1, -12] for i, v in enumerate(a): print(i, ': ', v)  results in\n0 : 2 1 : -3.3 2 : hello 3 : 1 4 : -12  You may figure out how enumerate works already. While iterating the list, enumerate assigns the index and the value to i and v, respectively.\nThe following block of the code does the same thing as above.\na = [2, -3.3, 'hello', 1, -12] for i in range(len(a)): print(i, ': ', a[i])  Python also has a while loop. It\u0026rsquo;s like any other while loop and begins with the syntax:\nwhile \u0026lt;condition\u0026gt;:  The code block (indented) that follows the while line is executed while  evaluates as True.\n"

	"title": "Module",
	"tags": ["module"],
	"description": "",
	"content": "When you write a script, the moment may come when you think there must be functions that can do what you want to do. Python calls \u0026ldquo;modules\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;packages\u0026rdquo; which is the collection of modules to assist users to do their job easily and quickly. (They are used interchangeably from time to time.) Unlike compiled languages like Fortran, these modules are not collections of object files but rather regular Python source code files. A module is a single source code file and a package is a directory containing source code files (and possibly subdirectories of source code files).\nTo use a module, users can call it with import command.\nimport \u0026lt;module name\u0026gt;  For example, you can call NumPy module for the computation regarding arrays.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import numpy \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; dir() ['__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'numpy']  or in IPython,\nIn [1]: import numpy In [2]: whos Variable Type Data/Info ------------------------------ numpy module \u0026lt;module 'numpy' from '/Us\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;kages/numpy/__init__.py'\u0026gt;  To use functions in the NumPy module, you can first write the module name, followed by dot and the function name. For example,\na = numpy.sin(4)  assign sin(4) to a.\nCalling \u0026lt;module name\u0026gt; with import is essentially the same as running the python file \u0026lt;module name\u0026gt;.py. As an example, let\u0026rsquo;s suppose that ctof.py has\nTinC = int(input(\u0026quot;Enter a temperature in Celsius: \u0026quot;)) TinF = 9.0/5.0 * TinC + 32 print(\u0026quot;Temperature:\u0026quot;, TinC, \u0026quot;degC = \u0026quot;, TinF, \u0026quot;degF\u0026quot;)  In Python, we can run this script with the command of exec(open('ctof.py').read()).\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s try\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import ctof  What do you get?\nFor import numpy, however, Python loads many functions that NumPy has because it is technically a package of many files, not a module of a single file. If all the module file does is define functions, variables, etc., then nothing will be output. But you have access to everything that is defined by typing the module name, a period, then the name of the module function, variable, etc. you want (hence, numpy.sin, etc.). Just as in a regular Python session you have access to all the variables, functions, etc. you define in that regular session, with an imported module, all the variables, functions, etc. that the module created and used are also sitting inside the module\u0026rsquo;s namespace, ready for you to access, using the syntax just mentioned.\nSubmodules (which are subdirectories inside the package directory) are also specified with the periods. For instance, NumPy has a submodule called ma, which in turn has special functions defined in it. The submodule then is referred to as numpy.ma and the array function in the submodule as numpy.ma.array.\nWhen importing modules, shorter name can be assigned. For example,\nimport numpy as np  Once you assign the shorter name, you can call the function with it, e.g. np.sin.\nIf you are interested only one function in the module, you can call it as the following.\nfrom numpy import sin  Finally, remember, modules can contain data in addition to functions. The syntax to refer to those module data variables is exactly the same as for functions. Thus, numpy.pi gives the value of the mathematical constant.\nYou can create your own module and it will be explained later.\n"

	"title": "Introduction to Object",
	"tags": ["object", "class"],
	"description": "",
	"content": " Python is an object oriented programming language. In fact, almost everything in Python is an object. Then what is an object?\nAn object is a variable that has attached to it both data (attributes) and functions designed to act on that data (methods). So what does this mean?\nThe key idea of objects is that variables shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be thought of as having only values (and type), but rather they should be thought of entities that can have any number of other things \u0026ldquo;attached\u0026rdquo; to them. If the attached thing is a piece of data, it\u0026rsquo;s called an attribute of the object variable. If the attached thing is a function, it\u0026rsquo;s called a method.\nThe following contents are from Chapter 7 of the textbook.\nProcedural vs. object-oriented programming Procedural programs look at the world in terms of two entities, \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;functions\u0026rdquo;. In a procedural context, the two entities are separate from each other. A function takes data as input and returns data as output. In the real world, however, we don\u0026rsquo;t think data and functions as separate entities. That is, real world objects instead have both \u0026ldquo;state\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;behaviors\u0026rdquo;. For instance, people have state (tall, short, etc.) and behavior (playing basketball, running, etc.), often both at the same time, and, of course, in the same person.\nThe nuts and bolts of objects An object in programming is an entity or \u0026ldquo;variable\u0026rdquo; that has two entities attached to it: data (attributes) and things that act on that data (methods). Importantly, you design methods to act on the attributes; they aren’t random functions someone has attached to the object.\nThe key syntax idea of objects is borrowed from module syntax: Just as you describe functions attached to modules by giving the module name, a period, then the function name, you describe things attached to a Python object by giving the variable name, a period, then the attribute or method name.\nThe variable types (e.g. string) we covered are in fact objects. Python includes these objects because they are used frequently. In Python, this common pattern or template is defined by the class statement. Using predefined classes, we create new variables and these specific realizations of that pattern are called \u0026ldquo;instances of that class.\u0026rdquo;\nExample of how objects work: Strings Python strings (like nearly everything else in Python) are objects. Thus, built into Python, there (implicitly) is a class definition of the string class, and every time you create a string, you are using that definition as your template. That template defines both attributes and methods for all string objects, so whatever string you\u0026rsquo;ve created, you have that set of data and functions attached to your string which you can use.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a string variables.\na = \u0026quot;hello world\u0026quot;  To see all attributes and methods, you can use dir() (You can still use dir() in IPython).\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = \u0026quot;hello world\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; dir(a) ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__getslice__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '_formatter_field_name_split', '_formatter_parser', 'capitalize', 'center', 'count', 'decode', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isdigit', 'islower', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'partition', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']  The string class has many methods attached to it. Let\u0026rsquo;s try a.upper()\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.upper() 'HELLO WORLD'  If you try a.title()\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.title() 'Hello World'  These upper and title functions only works for string variables because they are defined under the string class. If you try to use them for an integer variable,\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b = 5 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b.title() Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'title' \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b.upper() Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'  With dir(a), you can get the attributes starting with double underscores, e.g. __doc__.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.__doc__ \u0026quot;str(object='') -\u0026gt; str\\nstr(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -\u0026gt; str\\n\\nCreate a new string object from the given object.

Other information such as str, hello world and 11 can be obtained by a.__class__, a.__str__() and a.__len__(), respectively.\nAttributes of the string class can also have their own attributes. For example,\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a=\u0026quot;hello world\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; dir(a.upper) ['__call__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__name__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__qualname__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__self__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__text_signature__']  You can access one of the attributes of an attribute using another period followed by the name of the attribute as the following.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.upper.__doc__ 'S.upper() -\u0026gt; str\\n\\nReturn a copy of S converted to uppercase.'  Exercise In the Python interpreter, type in:\na = 'The rain in Seoul.'  Given string a:\n Create a new string b that is a but all in uppercase. Is a changed when you create b? How would you test to see whether b is in uppercase? That is, how could you return a boolean that is True or False depending on whether b is uppercase? How would you calculate the number of occurrences of the letter “n” in a?    "

	"content": " \u0026ldquo;Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.\u0026rdquo; (from the Python documentation)\nWe can define our own type of object by creating a new class that can carry attributes and methods to maintaining and modifying its state.\nWhen we define a new variable, we actually create a new instance of a class. For example, typing a = 'hello' creates an instance of a predefined string class. Likewise, we can create a new class instance that has the format of the class we defined.\nClass definition syntax The simplest form of class definition looks like this:\nclass ClassName: \u0026lt;statement-1\u0026gt; . . . \u0026lt;statement-N\u0026gt;  Class definitions start with class statement. The definition of the class follows from the next line with indentations at the beginning of the lines. Definition of the class must be done before using it. The \u0026lt;statement-i\u0026gt; in the class definition can be method definitions as well as attribute statements.\nClass objects Class objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.\nAttribute references are defined as obj.name. For example,\nclass MyClass: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; A simple example class \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; i = 100 def f(self): return 'hello'  Within the definition, you refer to the instance of the class as self. So, you can refer to the attribute defined earlier as self.\u0026lt;attribute name\u0026gt;, and the method (or function) as self.\u0026lt;method name\u0026gt; (e.g. self.data or self.calculate).\nIn this example, the class MyClass has attributes, i that returns an integer, and f() that is a function object. These attributes are referred to MyClass.i and MyClass.f, respectively. There is another attribute: __doc__ returns the docstring enclosed with three double quotation marks.\nClass instantiation uses function notation. To create an instance x in the class MyClass, you can simply type as the following:\nx = MyClass()  Then, you can access the attributes as the following:\nx.i x.f()  Or you can also get attributes with\nMyClass.i MyClass.f(x)  The expression is consistent with the f() definition.\nWhen you create an instance of your own object, you may want to customize the initialization of the instance. This method is called whenever you create an instance of the class, and so you usually put code that handles the arguments present when you create (or instantiate) an instance of a class and conducts any kind of initialization for the object instance.\nclass MyClass: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; A simple example class \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; def __init__(self): self.data = [] i = 100 def f(self): return 'hello'  If you create a variable with this class, you can see additional attribute, data.\nx = MyClass() print(x.data)  The example above does not take any inputs and the initialization of x doesn\u0026rsquo;t do anything but creating a space called data. The following example now takes an input to initialize the instant x.\nclass MyClass: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; A simple example class \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; def __init__(self, data): self.data = data i = 100 def f(self): return 'hello'  If you try to create a new variable x as above, you will get an error.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; x = MyClass() Traceback (most recent call last): File \u0026quot;\u0026lt;stdin\u0026gt;\u0026quot;, line 1, in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data'  Instead, you can create x by providing the initial value.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; x = MyClass(10) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(x.data) 10  A Practical Example This class provides a template for holding and manipulating information about a book. The class definition provides a single method (besides the initialization method) that returns a formatted bibliographic reference for the book. The code below gives the class definition and then creates two instances of the class (note line continuations are added to fit the code on the page):\nclass Book(object): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Objective : This class organizes the information of books \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; def __init__(self, authorlast, authorfirst, \\ title, place, publisher, year): self.authorlast = authorlast self.authorfirst = authorfirst self.title = title self.place = place self.publisher = publisher self.year = year def write_bib_entry(self): return self.authorlast \\ + ', ' + self.authorfirst \\ + ', ' + self.title \\ + ', ' + self.place \\ + ': ' + self.publisher + ', ' \\ + self.year + '.'  Line 1 begins the class definition. By convention, class names follow the CapWords convention (capitalize the first letter of every word). The argument in the class statement is a special object called object. This has to do with the objective-oriented project idea, which is a topic beyond the scope of this class. In Python3, you can skip object as in the MyClass example, but please read this page for more information.\nLine 2-4 contains docstring. In IPython, after defining Book class, you can check the docstring with\nIn [2]: Book? Init signature: Book(authorlast, authorfirst, title, place, publisher, year) Docstring: Objective : This class organizes the information of books Type: type  The arguments list of __init__ is the list of arguments passed in to the constructor of the class, which is called when you use the class name with calling syntax.\nYou can define instances as the following.\nbeauty = Book( \u0026quot;Dubay\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Thomas\u0026quot; \\ , \u0026quot;The Evidential Power of Beauty\u0026quot; \\ , \u0026quot;San Francisco\u0026quot; \\ , \u0026quot;Ignatius Press\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1999\u0026quot; ) pynut = Book( \u0026quot;Martelli\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Alex\u0026quot; \\ , \u0026quot;Python in a Nutshell\u0026quot; \\ , \u0026quot;Sebastopol, CA\u0026quot; \\ , \u0026quot;O'Reilly Media, Inc.\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2003\u0026quot; )  Then, you can get the formatted output of the book information.\nIn [4]: pynut.write_bib_entry() Out[4]: \u0026quot;Martelli, Alex, Python in a Nutshell, Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2003.\u0026quot;  It is noted that the write_bib_entry method is called with no input parameters, but in the class definition, I still need to provide it with self as an input. That way, the method definition is able to make use of all the attributes and methods attached to self.\nIn defining the class, you need to be consistent with indentation. Try the following example.\nclass Book(object): def __init__(self, authorlast, authorfirst, \\ title, place, publisher, year): self.authorlast = authorlast self.authorfirst = authorfirst self.title = title self.place = place self.publisher = publisher self.year = year def write_bib_entry(self): return self.authorlast \\ + ', ' + self.authorfirst \\ + ', ' + self.title \\ + ', ' + self.place \\ + ': ' + self.publisher + ', ' \\ + self.year + '.'  Does the Book class have the method write_bib_entry?\nIn the example above, we defined a function, write_bib_entry. It is not a part of Book, so that when you try\nIn [5]: pynut.write_bib_entry() --------------------------------------------------------------------------- AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last) \u0026lt;ipython-input-10-de7a795a67da\u0026gt; in \u0026lt;module\u0026gt;() ----\u0026gt; 1 pynut.write_bib_entry() AttributeError: 'Book' object has no attribute 'write_bib_entry'  But,\nIn [6]: write_bib_entry(pynut) Out[6]: \u0026quot;Martelli, Alex, Python in a Nutshell, Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2003.\u0026quot;  Why does this work? What is the role of self in write_bib_entry?\nexercise  How would you print out the author attribute of the pynut instance (at the interpreter, after running the file)? If you type print beauty.write_bib_entry() at the interpreter (after running the file), what will happen? How would you change the publication year for the beauty book to \u0026quot;2010\u0026quot;?  Remarks on class  It is not necessary that the function definition is textually enclosed in the class definition: assigning a function object to a local variable in the class is also ok. For example:  # Function defined outside the class def f1(self, x, y): return min(x, x+y) class C: f = f1 def g(self): return 'hello world' h = g  Then C has three attributes, f, g, and h. f requires two inputs to determine the minimum number, but g and h need no input (and they are identical).\n Methods may call other methods by using method attributes of the self argument:  class Bag: def __init__(self): self.data = [] def add(self, x): self.data.append(x) def addtwice(self, x): self.add(x) self.add(x)  In the method addtwice, the method add was called.\nIn [12]: y = Bag() In [13]: y.add(3) In [14]: y.data Out[14]: [3] In [15]: y.addtwice(4) In [16]: y.data Out[16]: [3, 4, 4]   Defining empty class can be done.  class Employee: pass john = Employee() # Create an empty employee record # Fill the fields of the record john.name = 'John Doe' john.dept = 'computer lab' john.salary = 1000   You can use its own class in the definition. ``` from math import sqrt  class Rocket(): # Rocket simulates a rocket ship for a game, # or a physics simulation.\ndef __init__(self, x=0, y=0): # Each rocket has an (x,y) position. self.x = x self.y = y def move_rocket(self, x_increment=0, y_increment=1): # Move the rocket according to the paremeters given. # Default behavior is to move the rocket up one unit. self.x += x_increment self.y += y_increment def get_distance(self, other_rocket): # Calculates the distance from this rocket to another rocket, # and returns that value. distance = sqrt((self.x-other_rocket.x)**2+(self.y-other_rocket.y)**2) return distance  The method ```get_distance``` takes the positional argument ```other_rocket``` which is also ```Rocket``` class.  Make two rockets, at different places. rocket_0 = Rocket() rocket_1 = Rocket(10,5)\nShow the distance between them. distance = rocket_0.get_distance(rocket_1) print(\u0026ldquo;The rockets are %f units apart.\u0026rdquo; % distance) ```\nObject-Oriented programming We are using the example script that can be downloaded from here\n"

IPython Interactive Python (IPython) gives you more functionality by providing a wider range of commands than python. To launch IPython, simply type\n$ ipython  This will give you\nPython 3.6.3 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct 6 2017, 12:04:38) Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information IPython 6.1.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help. In [1]:  Here, you can follow the same procedure as in python to have the program of the unit converter.\nIn [1]: TinC = int(input(\u0026quot;Enter a temperature in Celsius: \u0026quot;)) Enter a temperature in Celsius: 30 In [2]: TinF = 9.0/5.0 * TinC + 32 In [3]: print(\u0026quot;Temperature:\u0026quot;, TinC, \u0026quot;degC = \u0026quot;, TinF, \u0026quot;degF\u0026quot;) Temperature: 30 degC = 86.0 degF  As already mentioned above, IPython provides useful functions. For example, if you want to know about the command input, you can type\nIn [4]: input?  If you want to know what variables are defined, type\nIn [5]: whos Variable Type Data/Info ----------------------------- TinC int 30 TinF float 86.0  IPython also provides many magic functions. The built-in magics include:\n Functions that work with code: %run, %edit, %save, %macro, %recall, etc. Functions which affect the shell: %colors, %xmode, %autoindent, %automagic, etc. Other functions such as %reset, %timeit, %%writefile, %load, or %paste.  You can always call them using the % prefix, and if you’re calling a line magic on a line by itself, you can omit %. For more information about built-in magic commands, please refer to IPython webpage\nTo exit IPython, you can do either quit or exit.\nPython script If the job requires more than a few lines of python codes, then typing commands can be overwhelming. Also, it is likely that you make mistakes. In this case, writing all python commands in a python script and running this script to get the result is the way to go.\nThe first thing to do is create a python script file using text editors. If you use vim, you can easily create a file by typing vim filename.py.\n$ vim ctof.py  Then write all python codes there.\n# This script converts temperature in Celsius to temperature in Fahrenheit. # # 2018.9.13 TinC = int(input(\u0026quot;Enter a temperature in Celsius: \u0026quot;)) TinF = 9.0/5.0 * TinC + 32 print(\u0026quot;Temperature:\u0026quot;, TinC, \u0026quot;degC = \u0026quot;, TinF, \u0026quot;degF\u0026quot;)  In this example, the first three lines start with #. Whenever a line starts with #, python just skips it. So it is useful to add an explanation of your code in the script file.\nYou can execute this script in a few different ways.\n1. In Python After launching python, you can execute your python script as follows.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; exec(open('ctof.py').read())  If you input temperature in Celsius when it asks temperature, you can get the result.\nEnter a temperature in Celsius: 30 Temperature: 30 degC = 86.0 degF  If you think that this is not a really convenient way to run the program, there are alternative ways.\n2. In IPython Running a python script in IPython is much easier than in Python. After launching IPython with ipython, you can just type\nIn [1]: %run ctof.py  to get the same result as in python. You can even drop the file extension.\nIn [2]: %run ctof  even just run ctof.py or run ctof will do the job!\nAnother way to run the script, copy whole lines and paste them in IPython. To paste copied lines in IPython, you can use a magic function %paste.\nIn [3]: %paste  Then IPython shows the copied lines below. This is particularly useful if you need to run a few lines of your python script.\nIPython allows you to open the text file with an exclamation mark (!) while you are in IPython.\nIn [5]: !vim ctof.py  This makes %paste really useful because you can open your script and get the necessary lines without leaving IPython.\n3. Using Python in the terminal You do not launch python to execute python scripts. In the terminal, you can run your script by\n$ python ctof.py  4. As stand-alone in the terminal If your script starts with\n#!/usr/bin/env python3  you can run this script without typing python in the terminal. When you save the script, make sure to change file modes to be executable.\n$ chmod 755 ctof.py  To run this executable file,\n$ ./ctof.py  Jupyter Notebook You can use Jupyter Notebook for running python commands or a script. First, launch Jupyter Notebook.\n$ jupyter notebook  Then you get to have a new window in your web browser showing the file system in the working directory. To start python, click new in the upper right corner and select Python 3. This will open a new tab that just looks like IPython.\nJupyter Notebook consists of cells. It is your choice how to compose the cell with your commands. You can add all the lines in one cell, or a simple line for each cell.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first copy all the lines in a single cell. Jupyter Notebook provides a help page, and it says that you can hit control key and enter key together to run the cell. When you run the cell, you are asked to give temperature in Celsius as before.\nIf we decide to use cells for each line, you will be asked to give temperature after run the cell with TinC = int(input(\u0026quot;Enter a temperature in Celsius: \u0026quot;)).\nOnce you are done, you can save the Jupyter Notebook file in the web browser.\nTo finish Jupyter Notebook, you can come back to the terminal where you typed jupyter notebook and hit ^C TWICE!\nIn the class, we can explore what Jupyter Notebook offers extensively.\nLaunch Jupyter Notebook remotely In some cases, you need to use a remote server for Jupyter Notebook. In the remote server,\n$ jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889  This launches Jupyter Notebook without opening web browser. Then on your local machine,\n$ ssh -N -f -L localhost:8899:localhost:8889 [accountname]@[servername]  and open the browser and go to http://localhost:8899 The web browser ask for the key, and you can find it in the terminal where you launch Jupyter Notebook.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " We handled list variables in the previous chapter, and we can add any types of data to the list, even another list! The computational overhead to support that flexibility, however, is non-trivial, and so lists are not practical to use for most scientific computing problems.\nIn other words, lists are too slow.\nTo solve this problem, Python has a package called NumPy which defines an array data type that in many ways is like the array data type in Fortran.\nAn array is like a list except: All elements are of the same type, so operations with arrays are much faster; multi-dimensional arrays are more clearly supported; and array operations are supported. To utilize NumPy’s functions and attributes, you import the package numpy. Because NumPy functions are often used in scientific computing, you usually import NumPy as an alias, e.g., import numpy as N or import numpy as np, to save yourself some typing. In the following context, it is assumed that the NumPy package is imported as np.\nCreating arrays The most basic way of creating an array is to take an existing list and convert it into an array using the array function in NumPy.\nmylist = [[2, 3, -5],[21, -2, 1]] myarray = np.array(mylist)   What does it happen when you try to convert the list [[2, 3, -5],[21, -2]]?  A row vector and a column vector can be made differently.\na = np.array([2, 3, 4]) # an array with three element b = np.array([[2, 3, 4]]) # a 1x3 row vector c = np.array([[2], [3], [4]]) # a 3x1 column vector  Sometimes you will want to make sure your NumPy array elements are of a specific type. To force a certain numerical type for the array, set the dtype keyword to a type code:\na = np.array(mylist, dtype='d')  where the string \u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo; is the typecode for double-precision floating point. Other options you have are\n f : single precision floating i : short integer l : long integer  To see the difference between single precision and double precision, let\u0026rsquo;s try\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; b = np.array(10./3., dtype = 'd') \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; c = np.array(10./3., dtype = 'f') \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(b) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(c)  np.array is the function that create a variable with the array object called ndarray.  Often you will find the moment when you want to create an array of a specific size but with unknown or undetermined values. In this case, you can use either zeros or empty functions.\na = np.zeros((3, 2), dtype = 'd')  or\na = np.zeros([3, 2], dtype = 'd')    How do np.zeros and np.empty differ?   Here is the answer from stackoverflow:\n empty() does not initialize the memory, therefore your array will be filled with garbage and you will have to initialize all cells. zeros() initializes everything to 0. Therefore, if your final result includes lots of zeros, this will save you the time to set all those array cells to zero manually.    Another array you will commonly create is the array whose elements increase or decrease monotonically. In this case, you can use the arange function.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = np.arange(10) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]  The array a has 10 integer elements. What if you want to create an array with floating numbers?\nIn [10]: a = np.arange(10.0) In [11]: b = np.arange(10, dtype = 'f') In [12]: print(a) [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.] In [13]: print(b) [0. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.] In [14]: whos Variable Type Data/Info ------------------------------- a ndarray 10: 10 elems, type `float64`, 80 bytes b ndarray 10: 10 elems, type `float32`, 40 bytes np module \u0026lt;module 'numpy' from '/Us\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;kages/numpy/__init__.py'\u0026gt;  In case you want to create an 3 by 4 array with random numbers,\nIn [22]: np.random.random((3,4)) Out[22]: array([[0.59544951, 0.38485189, 0.42626703, 0.38313338], [0.51624656, 0.04025792, 0.65402374, 0.70589402], [0.1984409 , 0.8254778 , 0.25162249, 0.89099201]])  It is noted that np.random is a submodule and it has a method called random.\nArray indexing Like lists, element addresses start with zero, so the first element of a 1-D array a is a[0], the second is a[1], etc. You can also reference elements starting from the end, e.g., element a[-1] is the last element in a 1-D array a.\nArray slicing follows rules very similar to list slicing:\n Element addresses in a range are separated by a colon. The lower limit is inclusive, and the upper limit is exclusive. If one of the limits is left out, the range is extended to the end of the range (e.g., if the lower limit is left out, the range extends to the very beginning of the array). Thus, to specify all elements, use a colon by itself.  In [14]: a = np.array([2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4, -2.2, 2.4]) In [15]: print(a[1]) 3.2 In [16]: print(a[1:4]) [ 3.2 5.5 -6.4] In [17]: print(a[2:]) [ 5.5 -6.4 -2.2 2.4] In [18]: print(a[-2:]) [-2.2 2.4]  For multi-dimensional arrays, indexing between different dimensions is separated by commas. Note that the fastest varying dimension is always the last index, the next fastest varying dimension is the next to last index, and so forth (this follows C convention). Thus, a 2-D array is indexed [row, col]. Slicing rules also work as applied for each dimension (e.g., a colon selects all elements in that dimension). Here’s an example:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = np.array([[2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4, -2.2, 2.4], [1, 22, 4, 0.1, 5.3, -9], [3, 1, 2.1, 21, 1.1, -2]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) [[ 2. 3.2 5.5 -6.4 -2.2 2.4] [ 1. 22. 4. 0.1 5.3 -9. ] [ 3. 1. 2.1 21. 1.1 -2. ]]  Then, what is a[1,2]? How about a[:,3]? a[1,:]? a[1,1:4]?\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a[1,2]) 4.0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a[:,3]) [-6.4 0.1 21. ] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a[1,:]) [ 1. 22. 4. 0.1 5.3 -9. ] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a[1,1:4]) [22. 4. 0.1]  It is also possible to get, for example, every other elements or every third elements.\nIn [13]: a[1,::2] Out[13]: array([1. , 4. , 5.3])  Python reverses the order if we give a negative number after two colons.\nIn [14]: a[1,::-1] Out[14]: array([-9. , 5.3, 0.1, 4. , 22. , 1. ])  The extraction of the element can be possible by passing the list of the index.\nIn [84]: i = [1, 3, 4] In [85]: a[2,i] Out[85]: array([ 1. , 21. , 1.1])  How about this?\nIn [7]: j = [0,1] In [8]: i = [2,4] In [9]: a[j,i]  This will give you the elements at the index (0,2) and (1,4) so that\nOut[9]: array([5.5, 5.3])  Suppose you want to extract all elements that are at the first two rows and the third and fifth columns.\nIn [11]: a[j,:] Out[11]: array([[ 2. , 3.2, 5.5, -6.4, -2.2, 2.4], [ 1. , 22. , 4. , 0.1, 5.3, -9. ]]) In [12]: a[j][:,i] Out[12]: array([[ 5.5, -2.2], [ 4. , 5.3]])  Array inquiry Arrays in Python are eventually object to which a list of attributes and methods are attached. Here are some of functions for the array inquiry.\nFor the 2-D array a where\na = np.array([[2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4, -2.2, 2.4], [1, 22, 4, 0.1, 5.3, -9], [3, 1, 2.1, 21, 1.1, -2]])  To get the size of the array, one can use np.shape(a) that gives (3, 6) in this example. If we want to know the total number of elements in the array, np.size(a) gives 18. It is noted that len(a) function that was used for list variables will return 3. To find out the data type, try a.dtype.char.\nArray manipulation In addition to finding things about an array, NumPy includes many functions to manipulate arrays. Some, like transpose, come from linear algebra, but NumPy also includes a variety of array manipulation functions that enable you to modify arrays into the form you need to do the calculations you want.\nCopying Let\u0026rsquo;s suppose we want to copy the array a to b as b = a. Then change the element b[0,0] = -2.0. What happens to a?\nIn [13]: b = a In [14]: b[0,0] = -2.0 In [15]: print(b) [[-2. 3.2 5.5 -6.4 -2.2 2.4] [ 1. 22. 4. 0.1 5.3 -9. ] [ 3. 1. 2.1 21. 1.1 -2. ]] In [16]: print(a) [[-2. 3.2 5.5 -6.4 -2.2 2.4] [ 1. 22. 4. 0.1 5.3 -9. ] [ 3. 1. 2.1 21. 1.1 -2. ]]  Interestingly, the array a is also changed and a and b are the same! In Python, the equal sign is not copying variables.\nTo copy the array, we can use the function, np.copy.\nIn [3]: b = a.copy() In [4]: b[0,0] = -2.0 In [5]: print(b) [[-2. 3.2 5.5 -6.4 -2.2 2.4] [ 1. 22. 4. 0.1 5.3 -9. ] [ 3. 1. 2.1 21. 1.1 -2. ]] In [6]: print(a) [[ 2. 3.2 5.5 -6.4 -2.2 2.4] [ 1. 22. 4. 0.1 5.3 -9. ] [ 3. 1. 2.1 21. 1.1 -2. ]]  This also applies to the list. To copy the list variable a to b, do b = a.copy(). Transpose The transpose of an array a can be done with np.transpose(a) or a.T:\nIn [44]: np.transpose(a) Out[44]: array([[ 2. , 1. , 3. ], [ 3.2, 22. , 1. ], [ 5.5, 4. , 2.1], [-6.4, 0.1, 21. ], [-2.2, 5.3, 1.1], [ 2.4, -9. , -2. ]]) In [45]: a.T Out[45]: array([[ 2. , 1. , 3. ], [ 3.2, 22. , 1. ], [ 5.5, 4. , 2.1], [-6.4, 0.1, 21. ], [-2.2, 5.3, 1.1], [ 2.4, -9. , -2. ]])  If we define an array as in the first example and transpose it, there is no change.\nIn [59]: a = np.arange(5) In [60]: print(a) [0 1 2 3 4] In [61]: print(a.T) [0 1 2 3 4]  To make the transpose effective, the array has to be a vector or a multi-dimensional array.\nIn [62]: b = np.array([[2, 3, 4]]) # a row vector In [63]: print(b) [[2 3 4]] In [64]: print(b.T) [[2] [3] [4]] In [65]: c = np.array([[2], [3], [4]]) # a column vector In [66]: print(c) [[2] [3] [4]] In [67]: print(c.T) [[2 3 4]]  Convert from N-D to 1-D array We can make a N-dimensional array to a 1-D array or a vector.

Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be nice to get a 2-D array whose elements are the x-values for each column and a 2-D array whose elements are the y-values for each row? The meshgrid function does just that.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s first create vectors for longitude and latitude with the space of 5 degrees.\nIn [2]: lon = np.arange(-180, 180, 5) In [3]: lat = np.arange(-90, 91, 5)  According to the indexing rule in Python, lon starts from -180 with the increment of 5 but stops just before 180. That means that 180 is not a part of the array lon. On the other hand, lat stops at 91, so it includes 90.\nTo create 2-D arrays for longitude and latitude,\nIn [4]: [X, Y] = np.meshgrid(lon, lat) # or X, Y = np.meshgrid(lon, lat) In [5]: print(X) [[-180 -175 -170 ... 165 170 175] [-180 -175 -170 ... 165 170 175] [-180 -175 -170 ... 165 170 175] ...

Using transpose function in NumPy, we can easily permute the order of axis.\nWhy on earth do we have to go through the transpose of the array? According to the docstring of tile, if the number of the dimension of the array is smaller than the length of the list in the second argument, NumPy prepends new axes to match the number of dimension. So a shape (3,) array is promoted to (1, 1, 3) for 3-D replication.  "

	"content": " So far we\u0026rsquo;ve learned how to make arrays, ask arrays to tell us about themselves, and manipulate arrays. But what scientists really want to do with arrays is make calculations with them. As a start, we discuss two ways to do exactly that. Method 1 uses for loops, in analogue to the use of loops in traditional Fortran programming, to do element-wise array calculations. Method 2 uses array syntax, where looping over array elements happens implicitly (this syntax is also found in Fortran 90 and later versions, IDL, etc.).\nGeneral array operation method 1: loops It may be straightforward to use iteration for the array operation looping through each element. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the following example.\nimport numpy as np a = np.array([[2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4], [3, 1, 2.1, 21]]) b = np.array([[4, 1.2, -4, 9.1], [6, 21, 1.5, -27]]) shape_a = np.shape(a) product_ab = np.zeros(shape_a, dtype='f') for i in range(shape_a[0]): for j in range(shape_a[1]): product_ab[i,j] = a[i,j] * b[i,j]  The flow of idea is\n Create an array with the same size of a or b. Iterate the slow varying direction Iterate the fast varying direction At each point, compute the multiplication  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s time how long the iteration takes to be done. Timing the process is quite simple in IPython because it provides magic functions: %timeit and %%timeit.\n%timeit takes the command in the following position. So it is useful to check how long(slow) the function is.\nOn the other hand, %%timeit takes multiple lines of code from the following line. So this is useful when we want to test the speed of the block of the code.\nIn this example, %%timeit is appropriate to measure the time.\nIn [1]: %%timeit ...: import numpy as np ...: a = np.array([[2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4], ...: [3, 1, 2.1, 21]]) ...: b = np.array([[4, 1.2, -4, 9.1], ...: [6, 21, 1.5, -27]]) ...: shape_a = np.shape(a) ...: product_ab = np.zeros(shape_a, dtype='f') ...: for i in range(shape_a[0]): ...: for j in range(shape_a[1]): ...: product_ab[i,j] = a[i,j] * b[i,j] ...: 8.76 µs ± 47.8 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)  Try to time the iteration when we need to compute large arrays.\nnp.random.seed(0) # to initialize the random number generation a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000) b = np.random.randn(1000, 1000) shape_a = np.shape(a) product_ab = np.zeros(shape_a, dtype='f') for i in range(shape_a[0]): for j in range(shape_a[1]): product_ab[i,j] = a[i,j] * b[i,j]  In my machine, this takes 501 ms ± 7.83 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each).\nGeneral array operation method 2: array syntax The basic idea behind array syntax is that, much of the time, arrays interact with each other on a corresponding element basis, and so instead of requiring the user to write out the nested for loops explicitly, the loops and elementwise operations are done implicitly in the operator.\nConsider the first example. We can get product_ab using the multiplication operator.\na = np.array([[2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4], [3, 1, 2.1, 21]]) b = np.array([[4, 1.2, -4, 9.1], [6, 21, 1.5, -27]]) product_ab = a * b  You can see that product_ab is exactly the same as above.\nUsing %%timeit, let\u0026rsquo;s measure the speed.\nIn [4]: %%timeit ...: a = np.array([[2, 3.2, 5.5, -6.4], ...: [3, 1, 2.1, 21]]) ...: b = np.array([[4, 1.2, -4, 9.1], ...: [6, 21, 1.5, -27]]) ...: product_ab = a * b ...: 3.75 µs ± 235 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000 loops each)  How about the elementwise multiplication for large arrays?\nIn [5]: %%timeit ...: np.random.seed(0) ...: a = np.random.randn(1000, 1000) ...: b = np.random.randn(1000, 1000) ...: product_ab = a * b ...: 50 ms ± 375 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)  Avoiding iteration makes the calculation about 10 times faster! (And you have fewer lines of the code.)\nIn this example, we see that arithmetic operators are automatically defined to act elementwise when operands are NumPy arrays or scalars. (Operators do have function equivalents in NumPy, e.g., product, add, etc., for the situations where you want to do the operation using function syntax.) Additionally, the output array c is automatically created on assignment; there is no need to initialize the output array using zeros.\nHere is the table of arithmetic operator implemented in NumPy.\n   Operator Equivalent function Description     + np.add Addition (e.g., 1 + 1 = 2)   - np.subtract Subtraction (e.g., 3 - 2 = 1)   - np.negative Unary negation (e.g., -2)   * np.multiply Multiplication (e.g., 2 * 3 = 6)   / np.divide Division (e.g., 3 / 2 = 1.5)   // np.floor_divide Floor division (e.g., 3 // 2 = 1)   ** np.power Exponentiation (e.g., 2 ** 3 = 8)   % np.mod Modulus/remainder (e.g., 9 % 4 = 1)    Exercise: Compute the potential temperature Write a function that takes a 2-D array of pressures ($p$, in mbar) and a 2-D array of temperatures ($T$, in K) and returns the corresponding potential temperature, assuming a reference pressure ($p_0$) of 1000 mbar. Thus, the function’s return value is an array of the same shape and type as the input arrays. Recall that potential temperature \u0012is given by: $$ \\theta = T\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p}\\right)^{\\kappa}, $$ where $\\kappa$ = $R/cp$ = 2\u0026frasl;7 for a perfect diatomic gas like the atmosphere.\nIf you go with iteration, you might come up with the following.\ndef theta(p, T, p0 = 1000, kappa = 2./7.): ny, nx = p.shape output = np.zeros((ny, nx)) for j in range(ny): for i in range(nx): output[j,i] = T[j,i] * (p0 / p[j,i])**kappa return output  Using array operation,\ndef theta(p, T, p0 = 1000, kappa = 2./7.): return T * (p0 / p)**kappa  Now, let\u0026rsquo;s use the real atmospheric data which is the climatological air temperature at 500 mbar and compute the potential temperature.\nAfter getting the data from this link, let\u0026rsquo;s read it in IPython.\nimport numpy as np data = np.load('T_p.npz') T = data['T']+273.15 # convert the unit from degC to K p = data['P']  As the code becomes long, It is convenient to write a script to include all the functions and scripts.\nimport numpy as np \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; Compute the potential temperature using pressure (mbar) and Temperature (K) \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; def theta1(p, T, p0 = 1000, kappa = 2./7.): ny, nx = p.shape output = np.zeros((ny, nx)) for j in range(ny): for i in range(nx): output[j,i] = T[j,i] * (p0 / p[j,i])**kappa return output def theta2(p, T, p0 = 1000, kappa = 2./7.): return T * (p0 / p)**kappa data = np.load('T_p.npz') T = data['T']+273.15 # convert the unit from degC to K p = data['P'] potT1 = theta1(p, T) potT2 = theta2(p, T) print(np.array_equal(potT1, potT2))  The command in the print function determines whether two arrays are identical. The output is True, which is what we expect.\nIf you time the speed of theta1 and theta2, you can see that theta2 is much faster.\nIn [11]: %timeit pt1 = theta1(p, T) 27.3 ms ± 91.1 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each) In [12]: %timeit pt2 = theta2(p, T) 109 µs ± 817 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)  Using array operator is 250 times faster!\n"

	"content": " We are going to look at more array operations using Numpy before diving into the linear algebra.\nFancy indexing NumPy offers more indexing facilities than regular Python sequences. In addition to indexing by integers and slices, as we saw before, arrays can be indexed by arrays of integers and arrays of booleans.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = np.arange(12)**2 # the first 12 square numbers \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; i = np.array( [ 1,1,3,8,5 ] ) # an array of indices \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[i] # the elements of a at the positions i array([ 1, 1, 9, 64, 25]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; j = np.array( [ [ 3, 4], [ 9, 7 ] ] ) # a bidimensional array of indices \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a[j] # the same shape as j array([[ 9, 16], [81, 49]])  The second example shows that Numpy returns the result in the same format of the input.\nWhen the indexed array a is multidimensional, a single array of indices refers to the first dimension of a. The following example shows this behavior by converting an image of labels into a color image using a palette.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; palette = np.array( [ [0,0,0], # black ... [255,0,0], # red ... [0,255,0], # green ... [0,0,255], # blue ... [255,255,255] ] ) # white \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; image = np.array( [ [ 0, 1, 2, 0 ], # each value corresponds to a color in the palette ... [ 0, 3, 4, 0 ] ] ) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; palette[image] # the (2,4,3) color image array([[[ 0, 0, 0], [255, 0, 0], [ 0, 255, 0], [ 0, 0, 0]], [[ 0, 0, 0], [ 0, 0, 255], [255, 255, 255], [ 0, 0, 0]]])  We can also give indexes for more than one dimension. The arrays of indices for each dimension must have the same shape.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a array([[ 0, 1, 2, 3], [ 4, 5, 6, 7], [ 8, 9, 10, 11]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; i = np.array( [ [0,1], # indices for the first dim of a ... [1,2] ] ) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; j = np.array( [ [2,1], # indices for the second dim ...

In case when you want to find the indices that satisfy the condition, np.where or np.nonzero can be useful.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; x = np.arange(9.).reshape(3, 3) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.where( x \u0026gt; 5 ) (array([2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2])) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.nonzero( x \u0026gt; 5 ) (array([2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2])) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; x[np.where( x \u0026gt; 3.0 )] # Note: result is 1D. array([ 4., 5., 6., 7., 8.]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.where(x \u0026lt; 5, x, -1) # Note: broadcasting. array([[ 0., 1., 2.], [ 3., 4., -1.], [-1., -1., -1.]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.nonzero( x \u0026gt; 5 )  When three arguments are provided, np.where considers them as np.where(mask, a, b) which can be roughly thought of as a[i] if mask[i] else b[i]. This is what happened in the last example.\nLinear Algebra Vectors Before starting, let me claify the notation of vectors first. A vector of length n is just a sequence (or array, or tuple) of n numbers, which we write as $\\mathbf{x}=[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$. Then the sum of two vectors, $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, is $$ \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\newline y_2 \\newline \\vdots \\newline y_n \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1+y_1 \\newline x_2+y_2 \\newline \\vdots \\newline x_n+y_n \\end{bmatrix} $$ Scalar multiplication is expressed as $$ \\gamma \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma x_1 \\newline \\gamma x_2 \\newline \\vdots \\newline \\gamma x_n \\end{bmatrix} $$\nAs we did last time, these operations can be done easily.\nx = np.ones(3) # Vector of three ones y = np.array((2, 4, 6)) # Converts tuple (2, 4, 6) into array print(x + y) print(4 * x)  Another way to do summation of two vector is\ndef add_vectors(v, w): return [vi + wi for vi, wi in zip(v, w)] add_vectors(x, y)  Similarly, the subtraction of vectors can be done using - or\ndef subtract_vectors(v, w): return [vi - wi for vi, wi in zip(v, w)] subtract_vectors(x, y)  The inner product of vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is defined as $$ \\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{y} = \\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}x_i y_i $$ Two vectors are called orthogonal if their inner product is zero.\nThe norm of a vector $\\mathbf{x}$ represents its \u0026ldquo;length\u0026rdquo; (i.e., its distance from the zero vector) and is defined as $$ ||\\mathbf{x}|| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x}^T\\mathbf{x}} $$\nIn Python, the inner product of $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is\nnp.sum(x * y) # Inner product of x and y  and the norm of it is\nnp.sqrt(np.sum(x**2))  or\nnp.linalg.norm(x)  Can you write a short function for the inner product operation using a single line for iteration?   How about the norm calculation?   def sq_sum_of_squares(v): \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; sqrt(v1 * v1 + v2 * v2 ... + vn * vn)\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; return sum(vi ** 2 for vi in v)**(0.5)   \nMatrices Matrices are a neat way of organizing data for use in linear operations. For notation, an $n\\times k$ matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is expressed as $$ \\mathbf{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} \u0026amp; a_{12} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; a_{1k} \\newline a_{21} \u0026amp; a_{22} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; a_{2k} \\newline \\vdots \u0026amp; \\vdots \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\vdots \\newline a_{n1} \u0026amp; a_{n2} \u0026amp; \\cdots \u0026amp; a_{nk} \\newline \\end{bmatrix} $$ If $n=k$, it is a square matrix. If $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}^T$, it is a symmetric matrix.\nHere are some basic operations for matrices.\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import numpy as np \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(a) [[ 1. 2.] [ 3. 4.]] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; a.transpose() array([[ 1., 3.], [ 2., 4.]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.linalg.inv(a) array([[-2. , 1. ], [ 1.5, -0.5]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; u = np.eye(2) # unit 2x2 matrix; \u0026quot;eye\u0026quot; represents \u0026quot;I\u0026quot; \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; u array([[ 1., 0.], [ 0., 1.]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; j = np.array([[0.0, -1.0], [1.0, 0.0]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; j @ j # matrix product array([[-1., 0.], [ 0., -1.]]) \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.trace(u) # trace 2.0 \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; np.diag(u) # Extract a diagonal array([1., 1.])  Linear problems One of the more common problems in linear algebra is solving a matrix-vector equation. Here is an example. We seek the vector $\\mathbf{x}$ that solves the equation $$ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}, $$ where $\\mathbf{y}$ is the observations and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the matrix containing explanatory variables). This problem imposes a set of linear equations, so the $i^{th}$ observation is written as $$ y_i = a_{i,1} x_1 + a_{i,2} x_2 + \\cdots + a_{i,k} x_k. $$\n1. When $n = k$ This problem has the same numbers of equations and unknowns. It means that there is a unique solution.\nA number called the determinant of the matrix tells us whether this matrix can be inverted or not. If the determinant of $\\mathbf{A}$ is not zero, then we say that $\\mathbf{A}$ is nonsingular. Perhaps the most important fact about determinants is that $\\mathbf{A}$ is nonsingular if and only if $\\mathbf{A}$ is of full column rank.\nThen the solution is just $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{y}$.\nIn IPython,\nIn [2]: A = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3) In [3]: np.linalg.det(A) Out[3]: 0.0 In [4]: A = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3) + np.random.rand(3,3) In [5]: y = np.arange(3) In [6]: np.linalg.inv(A) @ y Out[6]: array([ 0.05905976, 0.79934638, -0.50158537]) In [7]: np.dot(np.linalg.inv(A),y) Out[7]: array([ 0.05905976, 0.79934638, -0.50158537])  2. When $n \\gt k$ In this case, there is no unique solution, but we can still seek a best approximation for $\\mathbf{x}$. After admitting that there must be errors associated with this linear problem, let\u0026rsquo;s introduce a vector $\\mathbf{n}$ that represents the error. Now the linear problem can be written as the following. $$ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{n}. $$ That the best estimate for the solution should lead to the smallest error. In other words, we want to pick $\\mathbf{x}$ that minimizes $$ J = \\mathbf{n}^T \\mathbf{n} = (\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y})^T(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}). $$ That $\\mathbf{x}$ satisfies $$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = 0 $$ Using\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\left( \\mathbf{q}^T \\mathbf{r} \\right)}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{\\partial \\left( \\mathbf{r}^T \\mathbf{q} \\right)}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} = \\mathbf{r}, $$ $$ \\frac{\\partial \\left( \\mathbf{q}^T \\mathbf{q} \\right)}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} =2\\mathbf{q}, $$ and $$ \\frac{\\partial\\left(\\mathbf{q}^T\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{q}\\right)}{\\partial \\mathbf{q}} = \\left(\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A}^T \\right)\\mathbf{q}, $$ we can obtain the solution as $$ \\mathbf{x} = \\left(\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{A}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{A}^T\\mathbf{y} $$\n3. When $n \\lt k$ This is the case when there are fewer equations than unknowns, suggesting there is an infinite number of solutions.\n4. How to solve the linear problem in Python If you choose to compute the inverse of the matrix,\nx = np.linalg.inv(A.T @ A) @ A.T @ y  or\nx = np.dot(np.dot(np.linalg.inv(np.dot(A.T, A)), A.T), y).  It is generally not recommended to directly compute the inverse matrix. Numpy has a function to solve the linear problem.\nx = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y)  Exercise We did the exercise to compute the potential temperature using $$ \\theta = T \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p}\\right)^k $$ when the temperature, pressure and the reference pressure are given.\nAt this time, let\u0026rsquo;s to find the linear expression of $T$ and $p$ for the potential temperature. You can get the data from this link.\nFile I/O For Numpy\u0026rsquo;s native file format, one can use np.save and np.load. These functions were used in our previous exercise.\nWhen you want to save the array in the text file, np.savetxt does it for you. When you need to read the text file, you can use np.loadtxt.\na = np.array([1,2,3,4,5]) np.savetxt('out.txt',a) b = np.loadtxt('out.txt') print b  If the data are somehow formatted with either comma or space, you can use np.getfromtxt. When example.dat has\n1800 1 1 -6.1 -6.1 -6.1 1 1800 1 2 -15.4 -15.4 -15.4 1 1800 1 3 -15.0 -15.0 -15.0 1 1800 1 4 -19.3 -19.3 -19.3 1 1800 1 5 -16.8 -16.8 -16.8 1 1800 1 6 -11.4 -11.4 -11.4 1 1800 1 7 -7.6 -7.6 -7.6 1 1800 1 8 -7.1 -7.1 -7.1 1 1800 1 9 -10.1 -10.1 -10.1 1 1800 1 10 -9.5 -9.5 -9.5 1  in Python, data will be 10 by 7 ndarray if is created by np.genfromtxt\ndata = np.genfromtxt('example.dat')  "
