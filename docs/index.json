	"content": " To get the most out of Linux, you should become proficient in using the shell. It might initially be more difficult than icons and menus, but once you\u0026rsquo;re used to it, the shell is quite easy to use and very powerful.\nHow to run a shell If you have Linux, running a shell is just opening Terminal or something similar to it. However, if you are running Windows (I think this is the most case), then you can experience Linux with the third-party program like MobaXterm.\nThis program offers a shell environment and (I think) you can do most of the common tasks of Linux with it.\nPlease get this (free) and set up in your computer.\nQuick start Once you install MobaXterm, go to \u0026ldquo;Session\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Shell\u0026rdquo;. This will open the terminal in bash shell environment.\nYou can check your shell environment by typing the follow command.\n$ echo $SHELL  This will give you /bin/bash.exe.\n"

	"content": "Every Linux file is contained in a collection called a directory. Directories are like folders on Windows and Mac systems. Directories form a hierarchy, or tree: one directory may contain other directories, called subdirectories, which may themselves contain other files and subdirectories, and so on, into infinity. The topmost directory is called the root directory and is denoted by a slash (/).\nWe refer to files and directories using a \u0026ldquo;names and slashes\u0026rdquo; syntax called a path. To find out the current path, try\n$ pwd  and you will get your current location in the filesystem.\nThere are two types of path. The first one is an absolute path. The absolute path starts from the root directory and has all the names of directories in the upper level. The second type is a relative path. The relative path does not start with the root directory or contain all the names of directories in the upper levels.\nTo move your location in the shell environment, you can use the cd command:\n$ cd /one/two/three  This command line moves you from your working directory (or current location) to /one/two/three. This example uses the absolute path to go to the new working directory. From here, you can use the relative path to go to /one/two with the following command:\n$ cd ..  In the shell environment, \u0026quot;..\u0026quot; means the upper level. (\u0026quot;.\u0026quot; means the current level.) You can use \u0026quot;..\u0026quot; as many times as you want. For example, if you want to move to /one from /one/two/three, you can type:\n$ cd ../..  Please note that you can achieve the same result with the absolute path:\n$ cd /one  Each user has own home directories where users\u0026rsquo; personal files are often found. In general, the path of the home directory starts with /home. To find out the absolute path for your home directory, try:\n$ echo $HOME  Linux offers a command that brings you to your home directory from anywhere. All you can do is just type cd with no arguments. It also provides a simple way to write the absolute path of your home directory with a special character, ~. Check this out.\n$ echo ~  You will get the same result as above. This special character can be quite handy. Suppose you want to move to Documents/Public in your home directory from /one/two/three. Then you can just type:\n$ cd ~/Documents/Public  If another username follows ~, the shell expands this string to be the user\u0026rsquo;s home directory:\n$ cd ~smith $ pwd /home/smith  "

	"content": " Unix/Linux? Most computing/programming in both atmospheric and oceanic sciences happens on Unix/Linux operating system, instead of Windows. What are the advantages of using Unix/Linux? I do not have the exact answer for why, but there must be a reason for people preferring typing and executing programs instead of clicking on windows (although Linux also provides graphical user interfaces).\nThe computing/programming in the atmospheric sciences means you create/read/process/write atmospheric data. All these jobs involve the design of the workflow from you, and it is important to be powerful, efficient and flexible in doing those. Unix is particularly suited to working in such an environment and has many powerful (and flexible) commands that can help you.\nAlso, according to Biocomputing Bootcamp, \u0026ldquo;The real strength of learning Unix is that most of these commands can be combined in an almost unlimited fashion. So if you can learn just five Unix commands, you will be able to do a lot more than just five things. Our objective here is to learn a subset of Unix and to become a productive Unix user without knowing or using every program and feature.\u0026rdquo;\nI refered to Linux, pocket guide by Daniel J. Barrett in introducing Linux system.\nHistory (and family) of Unix A varied operating systems, including macOS, have branched out from Unix. Simplified history of Unix-like operating systems (Wikipedia).\nLinux is one of the operating system that stems from UNIX and naturally shares similar architecture and concepts. It is an open-source software!\nPrograming on Linux \u0026ldquo;A common feature of Unix-like systems, Linux includes traditional specific-purpose programming languages targeted at scripting, text processing and system configuration and management in general. Linux distributions support shell scripts, awk, sed and make. Many programs also have an embedded programming language to support configuring or programming themselves. For example, regular expressions are supported in programs like grep and locate, the traditional Unix MTA Sendmail contains its own Turing complete scripting system, and the advanced text editor GNU Emacs is built around a general purpose Lisp interpreter.\u0026rdquo; (From Wikipedia)\nFour major parts in Linux The kernel The low-level operation system, handling files, disks, networking and other necessities we take for granted.\nSupplied program Thousands of programs for file manipulation, text editing, mathematics, typesetting, audio, video, computer programming, website creation, encryption\u0026hellip; you name it.\nThe shell A user interface for typing commands, executing them, and displaying results. There are various shells in existence: the Bourne shell, Korn shell, C shell, and others. We will focus on bash, the Bourne Shell, which is often the default for user accounts. However, all these shells have similar basic functions.\nX A graphical system that provides windows, menus, icons, mouse support, and other familiar GUI elements. More complex graphical environments are built on X; the most popular are KDE and GNOME.\n"
