      <description>To get the most out of Linux, you should become proficient in using the shell. It might initially be more difficult than icons and menus, but once you&amp;rsquo;re used to it, the shell is quite easy to use and very powerful.
How to run a shell If you have Linux, running a shell is just opening Terminal or something similar to it. However, if you are running Windows (I think this is the most case), then you can experience Linux with the third-party program like MobaXterm.</description>

      <description>Filesystem structure Every Linux file is contained in a collection called a directory. Directories are like folders on Windows and Mac systems. Directories form a hierarchy, or tree: one directory may contain other directories, called subdirectories, which may themselves contain other files and subdirectories, and so on, into infinity. The topmost directory is called the root directory and is denoted by a slash (/).
Path We refer to files and directories using a &amp;ldquo;names and slashes&amp;rdquo; syntax called a path.</description>

      <description>Once we arrive the working directory, the next thing we want to do might be manipulating files: copying, renaming, deleting and so forth. This page introduces a few things that can be useful in handling files in a Linux system.
If you need a short guide for the command, try with --help option. The content on this page mostly comes from Linux pocket guide by Daniel J. Barrett.
 ls [options] [files] The ls command lists attributes of files and directories.</description>

      <description>1. File viewing In Linux, you are going to handle files with lots of different types, and want to see what&amp;rsquo;s in there. On this page, we will explore how to view the file contents if they are in text in the Linux system.
cat [options] [files] The simplest viewer is cat, which just copies its files to standard output, concatenating them.
$ cat filename  This command dump all the contents on the screen, so large files will likely scroll off screen.</description>
